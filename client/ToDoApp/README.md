Todo
Description
This is a todo app... aaaand thats it thank you for coming to my ted talk. Anyway yes this is a very common website but
for learning purposes it was great I learned a lot about backend, system creation/devlopment and how to safely do http requests and
interact with a database. It has a fairly unique ui and more things then I think most would implement. Login, ids, folders, task names, task, and descriptions.
I learned a ton during its creation and am proud I did it
How it works
The I tried to keep the app very component based. It interacts with the backend through node and express which then goes through the server. It rather secure using
JWT and cors. Its hosted on an ec2 in the cloud throguh AWS it uses ubuntu and caddy for hosting
